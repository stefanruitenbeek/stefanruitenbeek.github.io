man called Maarten Arntzenius</b>.
Please sit back and relax to let this man sink in. In first instance,
he might look a bit normal in a weird sort of uninteresting banal sort
of way. But his syntax and psychological state really got me
fascinated. And I also really appreciate his willingness to discuss and
share without&nbsp; judging me for being curious and wanting to know
all
these things.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>I met him in the mediamarkt </b>when I was
thinking about buying a
device. He was working there and I asked him for advice. He started
asking me philosophical questions. I wanted to film him. In the
mediamarkt it's not allowed to film. (I had a problem once with a
security guard inside Mediamarkt for filming the staircase, he was
rather aggressive,). So I proposed to meet at his house. This film is
the result of just 3 meetings over a 2 month time span.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>His main topic is women</b> and what they are
doing to men. That's
what he talks about mostly. He is writing a book titled: 'The Amazon
Woman 2.0'. During the filming session his theories and thoughts about
woman are sort of supplemented (or countered, tested) by 3 elements and
happenings that happen to take place during the period of me filming
him.<br>
                  <br>
Element 1: HIS MOTHER<br>
I get the impression that his relationship with his mother is very
telling about the way he relates to women so I start filming her as
well. Then I discover that she is about to end her life. I'm interested
in the way Maarten deals with this. <br>
                  <br>
Element 2: A NEW DAUGHTER<br>
He also discovers that he has a daughter of 21, and he feels
semi-betrayed by the mother who never told him about this.<br>
                  <br>
Element 3:<br>
Finding&nbsp; new love. Falling in and out of love with various women.</font></td>

Note: I construct these films for a concentrated watch, watch
preferably on a larger screen with good sound. I didnt compress the
sound for mini speakers. There is actually a dynamic range in the
audio. Feel free to download the entire thing <a href="here.html">here</a>.
So you might not be bothered by streaming stutters. </font><font face="Roboto">DUTCH - NO ENGLISH SUBS YET.<br>

AMATEURS. </b>This film was tailor made to be shown as an art install
in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (the Bureau project space they have)<b>.
                  </b>It follows a small group of porn actors in their
attempt to make an art film.<br>
                  <br>
And in their
attempt to make something artistic, they start using strategies that
are very
similar to what most professional artists do: trying to discover what
is
'real' or 'essential' about something and conveying that within the
artpiece.<br>
                  <br>
In this case, the porn-actors conclude that porn is sort of fake
because it isn't about reproduction and creating life and making
babies. In order to reconnect to some sort of essence, they make a film
in which their pornography does have consequences: Babies are born. The
dramatic aspect is that every baby seems to be immediately trapped into
a rigourous life circle. Once a baby is born, it is immediately
impregnated in order to reproduce and die. <b><br>
                  <br>
                  </b>The film shows 2 life cycles and one dying event.
But it is also at the same time a making-of documentary.<b><br>
