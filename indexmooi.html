This film was made to be shown as an art install in the Stedelijk
Museum Amsterdam (the Bureau project space they have). It follows a
small group of porn actors in their attempt to make an art film.<br>
                  <br>
And in their attempt to make something artistic, they start using
strategies that are very similar to what most professional artists do:
trying to discover what is 'real' or 'essential' about something and
conveying that within the artpiece.<br>
                  <br>
In this case, the porn-actors conclude that porn is sort of fake
because it isn't about reproduction and creating life and making
babies. In order to reconnect to some sort of essence, they make a film
in which their pornography does have consequences: Babies are born. The
dramatic aspect is that every baby seems to be immediately trapped into
a rigourous life circle. Once a baby is born, it is immediately
impregnated in order to reproduce and die.<br>
                  <br>
The film shows 2 life cycles and one dying event. But it is also at the
same time a making-of documentary</td>

A study of a man called Maarten. I met him in the electronica shop
where he works. I asked him for advice on a thing I wanted to buy, but
out of nowhere he started to talk to me about women. That was
fascinating to me. So I proposed to meet at his house. This film is the
result of 3 meetings over a 2 month time span.<br>
                  <br>
His main topic is women and what they are doing to men. He is writing a
book titled: 'The Amazon Woman 2.0'. During the filming session his
theories and thoughts about woman are sort of supplemented by 3 things
that happen during the period of me filming him.<br>
                  <br>
1: His mother<br>
I get the impression that his relationship with his mother is very
telling about the way he relates to women so I start filming her as
well. Then I discover that she is about to end her life. I'm interested
in the way Maarten deals with this.<br>
                  <br>
2: A new daughter<br>
He also discovers that he has a daughter of 21, and he feels
semi-betrayed by the mother who never told him about this.<br>
                  <br>
3: Love<br>
Finding&nbsp; new love. Falling in and out of love with various women.<br>
