                  <br>

Looking at work by Saskia Van Imhoff and Alicja Kwade 
at De Appel arts centre, Amsterdam, March 2016<br>
                  <br>
A lot of artist these days present themselves as a sort of
'discoverers' of contemporary culture. They present there findings as
precious artifacts, powerful and contemplative in their meaningless
ambiguity. A pseudo scientific objectivity gives these wornout acts of
appropriation a sort of genteel legitimate aura. In this video we look
at the work of 2 of these&nbsp; archeo-artists: we strongly disaprove
of the work -even within the genre of archaeo-art it seems very weak-
and we also explain why a government funded institute with its army of
curators pays attention to this genre. Archaeo art is silly, but it is
part of our world and we keep running in to archaeo-art when we walk
into museums and project spaces. This videoclip is the result of taking
a videocamera during one of these visits.<br>

Language: Dutch, English Subs<br>
2011-2012<br>
                  <br>CONTAINS HARDCORE SEX<br>
                  <br>
This film was made to be shown as an art install in the Stedelijk
Museum Amsterdam (the Bureau project space they have). It follows a
small group of porn actors in their attempt to make an art film.<br>
                  <br>
And in their attempt to make something artistic, they start using
strategies that are very similar to what most professional artists do:
trying to discover what is 'real' or 'essential' about something and
conveying that within the artpiece.<br>
                  <br>
In this case, the porn-actors conclude that porn is sort of fake
because it isn't about reproduction and creating life and making
babies. In order to reconnect to some sort of essence, they make a film
in which their pornography does have consequences: Babies are born. The
dramatic aspect is that every baby seems to be immediately trapped into
a rigourous life circle. Once a baby is born, it is immediately
impregnated in order to reproduce and die.<br>
                  <br>
The film shows 2 life cycles and one dying event. But it is also at the
same time a making-of documentary<br>
