                  THE ARTIST AS ARCHAEOLOGIST AND WHY THATS A BAD IDEA<br>

                  <br>


Looking at work by Saskia Van Imhoff and Alicja Kwade 
at De Appel arts centre, Amsterdam, March 2016<br>

                  <br>

A lot of artist these days present themselves as a sort of
'discoverers' of contemporary culture. They present there findings as
precious artifacts, powerful and contemplative in their meaningless
ambiguity. A pseudo scientific objectivity gives these wornout acts of
appropriation a sort of genteel legitimate aura. In this video we look
at the work of 2 of these&nbsp; archeo-artists: we strongly disaprove of the
work -even within the genre of archaeo-art it seems very weak- and we
also explain why a government funded institute with its army of
curators pays attention to this genre. Archaeo art is silly, but it is
part of our world and we keep running in to archaeo-art when we walk
into museums and project spaces. This videoclip is the result of taking
a videocamera during one of these visits.<br>
